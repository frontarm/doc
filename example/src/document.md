export const demoboardHelpers = {
  'App.js': require('!raw-loader!./document/App.js'),
}

The Minimal Example
===================

After spinning up a fresh app with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), start by installing the `navi` and `react-navi` packages:

```bash
npm install --save navi react-navi
```

This leaves you with just three short steps to creating an app with asynchronous content and smooth transitions between pages.


Step 1: Declare some pages
--------------------------

To declare your pages, you'll use Navi's `createSwitch()` and `createPage()` functions. Switches are used to map URL paths to pages. Pages represent individual locations that you can navigate to.

```js
//---
  editorFilename: "pages/Reference.js"
//--- pages.js
import { createPage, createSwitch } from 'navi'
import * as React from 'react'
import { NavLink } from 'react-navi'

export default createSwitch({
  paths: {
    '/': createPage({
      title: "Navi",
      content:
        <div>
          <h2>Navi</h2>
          <p>A router/loader for React</p>
          <nav><NavLink href='/reference'>API Reference</NavLink></nav>
        </div>
    }),

    '/reference': createPage({
      title: "API Reference",
      getContent: () => import('./Reference.js')
    }),
  }
})
//--- pages/Reference.js
import * as React from 'react'
import { NavLink } from 'react-navi'

export default function Reference() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Reference</h2>
      <p>Coming soon.</p>
    </div>
  )
}
//--- index.js
import * as React from 'react'
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { createBrowserNavigation } from 'navi'
import pages from './pages'
import App from './App'

async function main() {
  let navigation = createBrowserNavigation({ pages })

  // Wait until async content is ready (or has failed).
  await navigation.steady()

  ReactDOM.render(
    <App navigation={navigation} />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}

// Start the app
main()
//--- App.js <-- App.js
```

As you'll see later, your content can be *anything*. You can return markdown, JSON, or even arbitrary functions! But `react-navi` has special support for React elements and components, so let's start by defining the content that way.

But what about the `/reference` page? It's not returning an element or component. It's returning a *Promise* to a component -- and this is where Navi shines. When the user clicks the "API reference" link, instead of immediately rendering a blank page, Navi will wait until `reference.js` has loaded --  and *then* it'll render the page.

```js
// pages/reference.js
import * as React from 'react'
import { Link } from 'react-navi'

export default function Reference() {
  retrun (
    <div>
      <h2>Reference</h2>
      <p>Coming soon.</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Step 2: Create `navigation`
---------------------------

Navi does all of the hard work within a `Navigation` object. This is where Navi watches for history events, matches URLs to pages and content, and turns all of this info into an object that you can use.

To create a `Navigation`, just call `createBrowserNavigation()` within `index.js`, passing in the `pages` object that you defined earlier. Once you have a `Navigation`, just wait for its initial content to become available -- and then render it!

```js
// index.js
import * as React from 'react'
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { createBrowserNavigation } from 'navi'
import pages from './pages'
import App from './App'

async function main() {
  let navigation = createBrowserNavigation({ pages })

  // Wait until async content is ready (or has failed).
  await navigation.steady()

  ReactDOM.render(
    <App navigation={navigation} />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}

// Start the app
main()
```


Step 3: Render your route
-------------------------

The `navigation` object that you just passed to `<App>` contains all of the information that you need to render your app. And while you *could* consume all of that information yourself, it's far simpler to just use Navi's built in components.

To start out, you'll only need three components:

- `<NavProvider>`, which wraps around your entire application
- `<NavRoute>`, which renders the current page's content
- `<NavNotFoundBoundary>`, which renders a 404 message when it catches a `NotFoundError` (as thrown by `<NavRoute>`)

Here's an example:

```js
// App.js
import * as React from 'react'
import { NavLink, NavProvider, NavRoute } from 'react-navi'
import './App.css'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NavProvider navigation={this.props.navigation}>
        <div className="App">
          <header className="App-header">
            <h1 className="App-title">
              <NavLink href='/'>Navi</NavLink>
            </h1>
          </header>
          <NavNotFoundBoundary render={renderNotFound}>
            <NavRoute />
          </NavNotFoundBoundary>
        </div>
      </NavProvider>
    );
  }
}

function renderNotFound() {
  return (
    <div className='App-error'>
      <h1>404 - Not Found</h1>
    </div>
  )
} 

export default App;
```

And that's it -- you've built a working app with asynchronous content! Of course, this tiny app is just an example, but Navi handles real-world apps with ease. In fact, [Frontend Armory](https://frontarm.com) is built with Navi.

Now that you have a working app, let's add a one more tweak as a bonus step...


Bonus: Loading indicators
-------------------------

Navi doesn't render the new pages until they have loaded, so there can sometimes be a large delay between clicking a link seeing the result. In cases like this, it's important to keep the user in the loop. And to do so, you can wrap your route with a `<NavLoading>` component:

```js
import React from 'react'
import BusyIndicator from 'react-busy-indicator'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NavProvider navigation={this.props.navigation}>
        <NavLoading>
          {isLoading =>
            <div className="App">
              <BusyIndicator
                color="#ff0000"
                delayMs={333}
                isBusy={isLoading}
              />
              <header className="App-header">
                <h1 className="App-title">
                  <NavLink href='/'>Navi</NavLink>
                </h1>
              </header>
              <NavRoute />
            </div>
          }
        </NavLoading>
      </NavProvider>
    );
  }
}
///pages.js
// TODO: add a delay to the pages so that the busy indicator is visible
```

The `<NavLoading>` component accepts a render function as its children, to which it passes a boolean that indicates whether its nested `<NavRoute>` component is waiting for  content. You're free to render this boolean however you'd like, but you can save yourself the trouble by importing and using `react-busy-indicator` -- the same loading bar used on this site.
